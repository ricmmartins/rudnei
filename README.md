# Microsoft cloud security diagram v3

This is an non-official Microsoft diagram built with the goal to explain the Microsoft cloud security big picture, that may be presented in a defense in depth model, with resources distributed according to Zero Trust pillars, to protect a common IT environment (in the top), against threats (in the bottom).

Threats in the bottom are just a simple example. The idea is that each company map your own concerns regarding threats, security vectors, APTs, etc. regardless the model or framework is the preference of Security team, Mitre Attack matrix, cyber kill chain or other.

in the left of the diagram, it is an example of a Ransomware attack in simple steps. This exercise allows to understand how different solutions may be used to mitigate and/or avoid a ransomware attack.
